# bowtie_dns_block_list (Resource)

Manage lists of DNS names that Controllers will reference to perform DNS-level blocking.

Names may be given as upstream URLs which will be retrieved periodically.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Use a third-party DNS blocklist for content blocking:

resource "bowtie_dns_block_list" "example" {
  name              = "Infosec Block List"
  upstream          = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/domains/tif.txt"
  override_to_allow = <<EOF
permitted.example.com
EOF
}
```
